# esp32_tyranitar

The ESP32-Tyranitar project is centered around the widely-used and budget-friendly microcontroller, ESP32, aiming to breathe life into one of Generation 2's iconic Pok√©mon, Tyranitar. Upon activation through a simple tap on the model, Tyranitar unleashes its distinctive cry sound, accompanied by a dynamic display of intense flickering lights, showcasing the characteristic of this pokemon based on it's description.

The code is written in micropython.

## Features
* <b>ESP32 microcontroller:</b> Versatile microcontroller for small IOT project that's perfect for controlling various hardware modules with saving power consumption with the deep sleep mode.

* <b>Sensor Integration:</b> Utilize tap sensor for interactivity and is used to trigger to mode to wake up from deep sleep mode.

* <b>Lighting Effects:</b> Intense flickering of multiple red LEDs upon waking up from deep sleep mode, followed by gentle breathing effect.

* <b>Sound Generation:</b> Plays iconic cry of pokemon, Tyranitar upon waking up from deep sleep mode.
